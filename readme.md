A variation of a todo list, built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/todo-list" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate data wrangling while implementing SOLID principles, incorporate **Webpack** to bundle JavaScript modules, handle asset management, compile SASS styles to CSS & various other **NPM** packages into the workflow.

I designed and authored this project using JavaScript, CSS, SCSS and EJS for templating.
